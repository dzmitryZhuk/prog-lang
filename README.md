Currently the syntax may contain the following constructs and rules:
* "ret" - identificator for returning from function or exit program
* ";" - identificator for split operations or operands or smth else; delimitor
* number - just literals that represents number

Now we can just exit program with some exit code:
```ret 0;``` or ```ret 42;``` or smth like this.
